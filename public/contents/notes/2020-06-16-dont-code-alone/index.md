I wrote this down in my notes the other day after hearing a colleague say it. It's such an interesting
concept for me. As developers it feels like there is some sort of inertia toward working on your own,
but whenever I pair program it always end up being a much more enriched experience. One of the biggest
things for me is that there is always some one learning when pair programming - and in the best cases
it's everyone involved. Jeff Atwood sums it up nicely:

> If you're serious about programming, you should demand to work with your peers.

The one hurdle I'm not sure how to overcome is the classic "I'm stuck and just going to Google for
15 minutes" situation. But maybe that's something I need to grin and bear? Either way, I'm trying
to make a habit of just dropping a video chat link to my team when I start a new task and asking if
anyone wants to jump in.
