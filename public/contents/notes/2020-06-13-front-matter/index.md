Markdown is great, but it doesn't have any built in metadata abilities. Front Matter seems to be
something of a semi-standard way of adding metadata to markdown docs. From what I can tell it originally
came out of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's basically just a slab of fenced off YAML at the
top of the file.

I'm personally a little against tampering with an open format like Markdown, but for my own personal
notes and posts I'm not too concerned.
