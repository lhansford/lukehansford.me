The name kind of explains it all. This is an app I created in 2013 while I was teaching myself to program. I was scratching a personal itch of needing a simple todo list on my Android phone's home screen. Apparently I was not the only one as the widget has been downloaded over 100,000 times. It's no longer supported as the Any.do developers stopped supporting their external API.

[Check it out in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gongchangstudio.minimalanydowidget&hl=en).
