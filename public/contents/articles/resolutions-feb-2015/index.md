In order to keep tabs on the progress of my resolutions for 2015, I'm going to try
and do a writeup at the end of each month to see how I've gone.

## Learn Malay

This resolution if going very well. I've managed to put in at least 30 minutes of
study for 4 out of 5 days in January, and my word count is at about 250.

## Get a tattoo

Haven't got a tattoo yet - I'm still dwelling on what to get (and where).

## Write a book

No progress on this yet, though I have some concepts for a story floating around
in my head.

## Make a book

This is coming along pretty well. The content of the book I'm putting together,
is about 75% done.

## Release an app

I've been hemming and hawing over this one. Today I'm going to have another crack
at getting started.

## Make candles

No progress on this.

## Be debt free

Definitely no progress in this. I'm still awaiting my first pay day for my new job.

## Go on a long-distance cycling trip

Same as above, waiting for pay to purchase a bike.

## Start a band, play shows, release music

I've been playing guitar, but yet to start playing with other people.

## Get in touch with people

Nope nope nope, failing hard on this one. I'm going to start thoroughly tracking
this in the hopes I've getting better at it.

## Don't use electronics thirty minutes before I sleep

Not to great at this. Sometimes I do, but I would say it's only 25% of the time.

## Make maps

No progress on this.
