In order to keep tabs on the progress of my resolutions for 2015, I'm going to try
and do a writeup at the end of each month to see how I've gone.

## Learn Malay

I dropped off a bit last month with my Malay study - I'd wager that I only studied around 50% of the days in February.

## Get a tattoo

Still undecided on what to get for this.

## Write a book

No progress.

## Make a book

No progress.

## Release an app

I've worked a little bit on a todo.txt app, but I'm not sure if I still want to follow through on it.

## Make candles

No progress.

## Be debt free

Negative progress, but I have the intention of paying off some in the next week.

## Go on a long-distance cycling trip

No progress.

## Start a band, play shows, release music

No progress.

## Get in touch with people

No progress.

## Don't use electronics thirty minutes before I sleep

No progress.

## Make maps

No progress.
