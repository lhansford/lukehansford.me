In order to keep tabs on the progress of my resolutions for 2015, I'm going to try
and do a writeup at the end of each month to see how I've gone.

## Learn Malay

I did almost no study in June. I'm going to have to make a concerted effort to get back on that horse.

## Get a tattoo

No progress.

## Write a book

No progress.

## Make a book

I've finished the design work, but I've been delaying on researching printing options.

## Release an app

No progress. I'm currently working on a new website project called cassette.space.

## Make candles

I no longer intend to complete this project.

## Be debt free

Money has been tight this month, and probably will be next month as well. I've started to keep a proper budget so that I can keep track of how much I'm spending.

## Go on a long-distance cycling trip

No progress.

## Start a band, play shows, release music

No progress.

## Get in touch with people

Still not doing this as frequently as I'd like.

## Don't use electronics thirty minutes before I sleep

I've taken to reading more often before I sleep (on my Nexus 7 tablet though).

## Make maps

No progress.
