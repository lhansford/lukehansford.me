In order to keep tabs on the progress of my resolutions for 2015, I'm going to try
and do a writeup at the end of each month to see how I've gone.

## Learn Malay

I've really fallen behind on studying Malay. The key to getting back at it will be to start waking up at 6 agian and working on it.

## Get a tattoo

No progress.

## Write a book

No progress.

## Make a book

I've done a bit of design work on this in the last week or so. Hopefully I can get it polished off by the end of this month.

## Release an app

No progress.

## Make candles

No progress.

## Be debt free

A little progress.

## Go on a long-distance cycling trip

No progress.

## Start a band, play shows, release music

No progress.

## Get in touch with people

Still not doing this as frequently as I'd like

## Don't use electronics thirty minutes before I sleep

Still failing.

## Make maps

I've been able to do a lot more of this in the last week. I've been collecting language data and am close to finishing off the Americas.
