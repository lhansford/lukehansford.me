## Reading

### [We have the techno-logy: building a Eurorack system for live techno](https://www.noiseengineering.us/blog/2019/1/4/we-have-the-techno-logy-building-a-eurorack-system-for-live-techno)

Noise Engineering has put together an overview of what you need in a Eurorack system to
make banging techno (with two Basimilus Iteritas Alters of course!). I'm going to be
cribbing some ideas for my setup from here over the coming week.

### [Assorted novels from Robert Jackson Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jackson_Bennett)

Over the holiday period I read 4 novels from American fantasy author Robert Jackson Bennett. I started with
_Foundryside_, which plays out as a fantasy story parsed through a cyber-punk heist caper. It's a
truely intriguing story and I'm pretty keen to read the next entry in the series later this year.

After that I went back and read Bennett's _The Divine Cities_ trilogy. The worldbuilding here was
also fascinating, delving into elements of colonialism and religion. While the pacing was as tight
as in Foundryside, I still found it an enjoyable read.
