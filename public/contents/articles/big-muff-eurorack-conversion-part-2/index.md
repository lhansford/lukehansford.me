## New Potentiometers

The reason for my Big Muff not being used in the first place was the real old potentiometers making a lot 
of unneeded noise when using it. Unfortunately replacement pots of the same size are really hard to come 
by. Instead I decided to use the standard size pots (you can see the difference in the pic above) and just 
make the panel holes bigger to accommodate them.

Replacing the pots was simple enough - cut the wires, solder on the new ones, done.

The only outlier was that yellow wire - I have no idea what it's supposed to connect too! Regardless, 
it worked out fine. Check out the crunchy results in the clip below.
