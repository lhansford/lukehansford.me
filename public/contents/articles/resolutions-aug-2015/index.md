In order to keep tabs on the progress of my resolutions for 2015, I'm going to try
and do a writeup at the end of each month to see how I've gone.

## Learn Malay

I started to study a bit more in July, but it has been more about catchup then learning anything new.

## Get a tattoo

No progress.

## Write a book

No progress, but I've started to write a bit more in July, which will hopefully lead to something more substantial.

## Make a book

No progress.

## Release an app

Not much progress. I've been working on a wiki-style website for music resources and am contemplating a OS X app, but with no solid plan at the moment.

## Make candles

I no longer intend to complete this project.

## Be debt free

A little bit spent, a little paid, I'm probably back at where I was at the beginning of the month.

## Go on a long-distance cycling trip

No progress.

## Start a band, play shows, release music

I purchased some gear (Volca Sampler, DI) to try making some electronic music on my own. Nothing solid put down yet though.

## Get in touch with people

Still not doing this as frequently as I'd like.

## Don't use electronics thirty minutes before I sleep

Did pretty terribly at this in July (mostly because Evelyn is back in Malaysia).

## Make maps

Only worked on this a couple of times in July.
