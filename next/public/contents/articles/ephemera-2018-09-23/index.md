### [How To Deal with Dirty Side Effects in Your Pure Functional Javascript](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2018/how-to-deal-with-dirty-side-effects-in-your-pure-functional-javascript/)

This is a great intro to a more intermediate level of functional programming in JS (and maybe just FP in general). Functors, monads, and general removal of side effects. The tie in with Tensorflow at the end is nice too! I've started a new job in the last month were
the main language I write in is Ruby. While there are touches of functional programming style, it is mostly classic OOP, and
it's made me very quickly appreciate how suited Javascript could be for functional programming if you use a little bit of
coding discipline.
