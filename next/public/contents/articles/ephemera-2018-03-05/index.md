I missed a few weeks there - Chinese New Year has a tendency to disrupt my routines - but I'm back at it now!

## Reading

### [The 100-year capitalist experiment that keeps Appalachia poor, sick, and stuck on coal](https://qz.com/1167671/the-100-year-capitalist-experiment-that-keeps-appalachia-poor-sick-and-stuck-on-coal/)

I find the economics and politics of the United States endlessly fascinating. It's such a kaleidoscope of
views, opinions, and histories. This article targets the political history of the Appalachian region
of the US. If you find this interesting check out the book "Dreamland" by Sam Quinones. It focuses on
the ongoing opioid epidemic in the US, but similar themes as found in this article pop up all over the place.

### [Bandcamp](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/02/12/the-bandcamp-2017-year-in-review/)

Yay for Bandcamp! For me it's the one major web company that has only had a purely positive impact
on the communities it is involved with (feel free to prove me wrong, I'm sure I'm forgetting some other companies).
It's great to see them continuing to grow.

### [The Donkey Kong Timeline Is Truly Disturbing](https://kotaku.com/the-donkey-kong-timeline-is-truly-disturbing-1823035151)

Some people have too much time on their hands, and I'm very glad for that.

## Listening

### [A.A.L. (Against All Logic) - 2012-2017](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3754267-AAL-Against-All-Logic)

I can't remember the last time I felt this way listening to house music. A.A.L. (bka Nicolas Jaar)
has tapped into the rawness at the core of house, a rawness that has been missing from most house music
I've heard in the last decade (with the big caveat that I don't listen to much house).
