### [Memorizing these three statistics will help you understand the world](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Max-Roser-three-facts-everyone-should-know)

The title is a little clickbait-y (though that's pretty run-of-the-mill these days), but the article
itself is still worthy. Essentially it's a bunch of statistics, and pretty well known ones at that, but
it is nice to have a condensed reminder of the positive changes humanity has made in the last century
and offset the general pessimism that seems to be the trend at the moment.
