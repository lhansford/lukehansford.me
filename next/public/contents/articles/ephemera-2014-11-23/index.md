This the first of (hopefully) many weekly roundups of the content I consume.
While I'm pleased to share this, I'm also starting to become more interested in
storing my activities so I can recall them long into the future. This is one way
of doing that.

## Reading

### [The Rise of the Professional Cyber Athlete](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/good-game)

A nice long article on pro-gaming from the New Yorker. A really nuanced take on
the subject (I think, my gaming skills are less than leet).

### [A Print Magazine for Hackers](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/print-magazine-hackers)

Another techy article from the New Yorker, this time profiling the hacker magazine/bible, 2600.

### [What papers should I definitely read as a computer science undergraduate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2jzjh7/what_papers_should_i_definitely_read_as_a/)

A reddit question that keeps on giving. As a computer science student this is
an invaluable resource.

### [Molly Crabapple's 15 rules for creative success in the Internet age](http://boingboing.net/2014/11/04/molly-crabapples-rules-for-c.html)

I can't get more descriptive than the article's title. Artist Molly Crabapple gives
some tips that are pretty spot on. I wish I'd had something like this before I started
traversing the music industry.

## Watching

### The Flash

My brother had been urging me to get into
[Arrow](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2193021/) for a while, and I finally got
the chance to while flying to Singapore last week. Cue intense binge watching
and the search for more. More came in the form of another superhero show based
in the same DC universe - [The Flash](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3107288/).
The whole concept of the Flash as a superhero felt a little lacking to me at
first, but I've been pleasantly
surprised at how well the creators have done on this show. It switches Arrow's
constant brooding for a bit more humour and some really excellent special
effects, while keeping the better bits such as the flashback stories.

## Listening

### Parquet Courts - Content Nausea

The latest release from Parquet Courts, [Content Nausea](https://play.google.com/music/m/Bxrpgmypli632vdxvrg6sx2fec4) has the usual
balance of raucousness and hooks I've come to expect from the Texan band. The title
track is particularly good.

### Fugazi - First Demo

I don't usually truck with demoes, outtakes, and the like. Music is a craft and
releasing half finished work is anathema to me. Having said that, I was surprised
at how enjoyable it was to listen to [First Demo](https://play.google.com/music/m/Bmvwiwr2flzwnxdvh4k7indgeze).
Fugazi are one of my favourite bands, and to hear them in action before they'd
nailed down their sound is intriguing. The songs are still great, but the
trainspotting to be done here for Fugazi fans is the selling point.
