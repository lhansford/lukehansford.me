## Reading

### [The Rise of China and the Fall of the ‘Free Trade’ Myth](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/the-rise-of-china-and-the-fall-of-the-free-trade-myth.html)

Pankaj Mishra is an author I always love to read so it was nice to stumble upon this NY Times Magazine
article from him. It's a divisive but intriguing take on the economic rise of the great nations. From my
on the ground experience in China I feel like he might be paving over some of the more free-wheeling capitalistic
tendencies that can be found in China at the moment or in the last two decades, but in general I'd agree with 
his main assertions.

### [Principles of Adult Behaviour](https://gist.github.com/hernamesbarbara/c647b18411157205edffcb94db0bcea8)

With the passing this week of John Perry Barlow, this list of "life lessons" seemed quite apt.

## Watching

### [Altered Carbon](https://www.netflix.com/title/80097140)

Damn this show was awesome. The story is a little weak at some points, but they absolutely
nailed the cyber-punk aesthetic and the acting is pretty top notch all around. Highly recommended.

### [EEVblog #186 - Soldering Tutorial Part 3 - Surface Mount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9FC9fAlfQE&app=desktop)

Just a great video on how to surface mount solder. I've got a Hot Air Rework station sitting in my workshop ready for its
first use and I've been feeling a bit nervous about it. This tutorial has definitely helped to allay some of those worries.
