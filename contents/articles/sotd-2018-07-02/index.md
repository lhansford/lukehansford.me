Boomgates were one of a number of "supergroups" taking their pick of members out of the excellent
Melbourne music scene circa-2012. They're also the one of the few that matched the quality of the bands
they were pulling from - no small feat given that those bands were Eddy Current Suppression Ring,
Dick Diver, and The Twerps.

The album Double Natural (the band's only album as far as I know), sees Boomgates trying to find a
nice middle ground between the two poles of the sounds of ECSR and Dick Diver/Twerps, and
"Flood Plains" is the only track that really nails it. The sliding garage solos and Escher-esque lyrics
of ECSR rub up against the pitch perfect pop of The Twerps and Dick Diver - a match made in heaven/The Tote for sure.
