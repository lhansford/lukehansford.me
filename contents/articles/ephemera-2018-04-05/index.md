Well I broke the chain again, though to be honest it was more just to a lack of anything to talk about rather
than procrastinating/forgetting to write something like usual.

## Reading

### [Provenance by Ann Leckie](https://www.amazon.com/Provenance-Ann-Leckie-ebook/dp/B06XW6YTKV/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

I spotted this on this year's Hugo Awards shortlist; I had no idea that Leckie has a new book out already, so it was a pleasant surprise.
I'm only about halfway through it, but Provenance is so far proving to be of the same calibre as the Ancillary series, with the same world-building that has a way of making you question your own preconceptions about society.

### [All rise and no fall: how Civilization reinforces a dangerous myth](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/15/all-rise-and-no-fall-how-civilization-reinforces-a-dangerous-myth/)

As a strategy game fiend and someone who sits very much on the political left, this article hit very close to home for me. A lot of
historical strategy games ascribe strongly to the "great men" view of history, paving over the realities of the eras they're set in. But it's of course a tricky situation for developer who must balance historicity with fun, and it seems to be a rather large challenge simulating the fall of a player's empire. As an aside, the article offer Crusader Kings 2 as a good example of an alternative to Civilization's growth at all costs mentality, but I'd suggest another game from Paradox, Victoria 2 as a better example - it's simulation of communist or fascist uprisings, or the brutality of an economic depression show a path where a player can lose almost all they've built up but still have the opportunity to turn it around and "win" the game.

### [Stephen Hawking (1942â€“2018)](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/03/stephen-hawking-obituary-als-nhs-bds)

There were lots of great obituaries for the great scientist Stephen Hawking, but I found this one particularly interesting due to 
it's insight into Hawking's political activism, an area of his life that I was unaware of.
