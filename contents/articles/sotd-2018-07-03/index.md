Murmur is probably my favourite or second favourite R.E.M. album (competing with Document). "Pilgrimage"
follows the better known "Radio Free Europe", and serves as an odd counter-point to the driving rock of that
album opener. It's a song the goes unexpected places. The chorus is stereotypical anthemic R.E.M.,
but the verses are all echoing vocals and stuttering guitar (and maybe xylophone?). The transition
between the two (and the excellent bridges) send chills down my spine every time I play the song.

You can listen to all of my previous song of the day picks in this [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/lhansford/playlist/5g8D964wkh7avEqmzD5LKY?si=yEPUBg2UQrW4tOPJrPe9Ug).
