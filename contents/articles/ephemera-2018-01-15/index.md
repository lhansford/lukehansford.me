It's been a while since I've done an entry here. I'm going to start dipping a toe back into 
blogging, beginning with writing these old weekly round-ups! I doubt anyone is reading at the moment, 
but it's a nice little thing to do for posterity's sake.

## Reading

### [The 25 best reissues and retrospectives of 2017](http://www.factmag.com/2017/12/10/best-reissues-2017/)

January is always reserved for listening to year ends lists for me, and the Factmag ones this year are killer. 
Top picks from this list for me are Midori Takada's *Through The Looking Glass*, Metro Area's self-titled release, 
and number one pick *Noir Et Blanc*.

### [Make: Analog Synthesizers](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Analog-Synthesizers-Electronic-Synth-DIY/dp/1449345220)

I've been picking up some DIY electronics skills over the last few months, and I've decided to dive into 
building my own synthesizer with this book as a guide. I'm still waiting on the parts to arrive so I 
can get started, but in the meantime it's a wonderful introduction into the inner workings of an electronic instrument.
