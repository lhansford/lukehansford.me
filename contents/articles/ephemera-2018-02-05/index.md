## Reading

### [How I review code](https://engineering.tumblr.com/post/170040992289/how-i-review-code)

A Tumblr engineer walks through his process for code reviews. I found this pretty instructive as I'm 
currently in the middle of trying to come to grips with formalising code reviews in my own company.

## Listening

### Lab Rat XL â€Ž- Mice Or Cyborg

This 2003 album just got a re-release and I've been listening to it all week while coding. Lab Rat XL
was a side project of Detroit Techno legends Drexciya, and this release was one of their last before the 
passing of James Stinson, one half of the duo. The tracks slot in nicely to the Drexciya ouvre of minimal-ish 
afrofuturist techno.
