## Reading

### [TypeScript 3.0: The unknown Type](https://mariusschulz.com/blog/typescript-3-0-the-unknown-type)

I'm immediately going to start using the `unknown` type in my TypeScript projects after learning
about it in this post from @mariusschulz. No more using `any` when I'm a little unsure of how to
type data coming from the server!

### [const assertions are the killer new TypeScript feature](https://blog.logrocket.com/const-assertions-are-the-killer-new-typescript-feature-b73451f35802)

"killer new feature" generally feels too hyperbolic for me, but in this case I kind of agree. We've

number of interfaces we'd usually write.

### [Building that admin dashboard](https://medium.com/fishbrain/building-that-admin-dashboard-9a24c5fe569)

Building admin tools can be surprisingly hard! One of my colleague's at Fishbrain has written a
great blog post on some of the challenges we've faced doing just that.

### [Fun with React Hooks - Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jWS7cCuUXw)

I really came away from these two talks with a much more comprehensive understanding of React hooks,
plus some great new ideas on how I could use them in my own work.
