Intro

I've been a little sporadic with these posts this year. Maybe next year I can be more consistent...or
maybe not.

## Reading

### [Blood and Soil in Narendra Modi's India](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/09/blood-and-soil-in-narendra-modis-india)

I was aware of Modi's political history, but not quite to the extent that this article lays out. It's
quite terrifying to me that this has become a somewhat normal political situation around the globe in
recent years (I'm thinking of the mass imprisonment of Uighurs and other minorities in China, the
extra-judicial killings that occur in the Philippines, and police brutality and state sponsored violence
occurring in numerous countries at the moment, among other issues).

### [52 things I learned in 2019](https://medium.com/fluxx-studio-notes/52-things-i-learned-in-2019-8ee483e6c816)

I know Tom Whitwell through the Eurorack world for his work as the behind [Music Thing Modular](https://musicthing.co.uk/),
but I've also grown to love his yearly round up of weird things he learnt in the previous year.

A few favourites:

> The goal of walking 10,000 steps per day may have originated when a Japanese pedometer manufacturer noticed that the 万 symbol (which means 10,000) looks a little like someone walking. The actual health merits of that number ‘have never been validated by research.’

> mobile phones became mainstream in the US in the early 1990s, the murder rate fell sharply. Street drug dealing became less popular, so gang-related turf wars were less common.

> Drunk shopping could be a $45bn /year industry, and only 6% of people regret their drunk purchases.
