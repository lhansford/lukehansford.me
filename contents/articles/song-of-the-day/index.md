I used to write a lot. Sometimes for work, sometimes for school. But mostly I used to write about
music. Over time I drifted more towards making music, then talking about music (see
[Frequency Asia](http://frequency.asia)), and now back again to making music. But I do sometimes
miss writing about music. There was always something appealing to me about the Sisyphean struggle
of trying to describe the indescribable. So with that in mind, I've decided to attempt to write a
little each day about a song that has influenced me, inspired me, or just generally made me a
happier person. I'm [lifting the concept wholesale from Tim Bray](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/31/Songs-of-the-Day),
who completed the same exercise over the first half of the year. Given that I'm writing this on the
first day of the second half of 2018, it makes sense to me to try and go for the same time frame.

I'm not going to have quite as many rules as Tim set for himself, but I do like having something of
a framework to operate within, so all the tracks I pick will be available on Spotify. I'll be
embedding them in each post and keeping an [up to date playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/lhansford/playlist/5g8D964wkh7avEqmzD5LKY?si=yEPUBg2UQrW4tOPJrPe9Ug).
I'm also going to look into some way of compiling them here on the blog, though that'll be coming a
bit later on.
