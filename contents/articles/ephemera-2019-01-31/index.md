## Reading

### [Gradually, Then Suddenly](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gradually-suddenly-tim-o-reilly/)

Tim O'Reilly reviews 10 areas of technology that he expects to see breakthroughs in over
coming years. It's a quick read, but one that'll probably inspire you in one way or another.
I'm particularly intrigued by the agricultural technologies he discusses, and that's rabbit hole
I'm now currently going down.

## Listening

### [Demdike Stare - Stitch By Stitch Tape 4](https://soundcloud.com/modernlove/demdike-stare-stitch-by-stitch-tape-4)

Turns out that Demdike Stare put out four tape mixes of dark dubby drones last year
(on top of the excellent album Passion). It's been my work soundtrack all week.

### [Various - Life & Death On The New York Dance Floor 1980-1983 Part I & II](https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/23381)

> "I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan" - LCD Soundsystem - Losing My Edge

The 80s NY disco scene is a musical era I'd heard spoken of before, but not one I'd ever explored
much besides the peripheries were it crossed over into New Wave or other 80s electronic movements. This
compilation definitely make me want to learn more about it though. The sounds here really bridge the
gap between New York new/no wave bands of the same time and the kind of music that was soon to be made for the clubs of
Detroit and Chicago (and later, Manchester).
