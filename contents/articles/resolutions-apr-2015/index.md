In order to keep tabs on the progress of my resolutions for 2015, I'm going to try
and do a writeup at the end of each month to see how I've gone.

## Learn Malay

I only missed nine days of study this month. My week point seems to be the weekends, as I missed almost all of them in March.

## Get a tattoo

No progress.

## Write a book

No progress.

## Make a book

No progress.

## Release an app

Back to square one on this. Rethinking whether I want to spend time working on Android stuff.

## Make candles

No progress.

## Be debt free

Paid off a chunk of my credit, still a way to go though.

## Go on a long-distance cycling trip

No progress.

## Start a band, play shows, release music

No progress.

## Get in touch with people

Been doing much better this month, with the aim of chatting with someone different every day.

## Don't use electronics thirty minutes before I sleep

Not doing so well on this. I tried to start meditating before sleep, but I'm not too great at meditation it seems. My aim is start getting at least 15 minutes of meditation in every night.

## Make maps

No progress.
