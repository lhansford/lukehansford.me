## Reading

### [What He Does With What He Has: Blawan Interviewed](http://thequietus.com/articles/24794-blawan-jamie-roberts-interview)

Like most people I became familiar with Blawan after hearing 'Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage', and his subsequent
disappearance from the musical landscape always left me wanting more. This interview with The Quietus
explains where he went to, and how he evolved from the frantic horror-dubstep of his earlier releases to the oddly-organic
minimal techno he's making nowadays.

### [The radical lessons of a year reporting on knife crime](https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/jun/21/radical-lessons-knife-crime-beyond-the-blade)

A fascinating look into the facts and perceptions of knife crime in the UK. Particularly interesting
are the parallels between violence and infectious disease, and how treating crime as a public health 
issue can yield results.

## Listening

### Blawan - Wet Will Always Dry

See the reading recommendation above! Excellently tailored minimal/industrial techno.
